Name: Codifier
Description: 
      An extension to ENUM.
      Tables "codes" and "codifiers" for storing standard sets 
      of constat values, status sets, etc. F.e., codifier "Colors" may contain
      codes: "Red", "Green", "Blue". 
      Any codifier may be a code of another codifier. 
      Thus codes may be ordered in form tree structures and 
      even directed graph structures.
      Package also contains abstract parent tables "names" and "named_in_lng".
      Table "named_in_lng" is a child of "names" and is connected 
      with "Languages" codifier. Table "codes_names" is a selfexample of usage 
      of codifiers and being a correct child of "named_in_lng" - it stores 
      humanreadable names, descriptions and comments on any codes and 
      codifiers in various languages.
