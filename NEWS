0.1
--------------------------------------------
* First prototype version of DB packager


Changes from 0.1 to 0.2
--------------------------------------------
* Completely different approach. Codes now may interconnect in grafs 
  of codifiers, whereas older version allowed only tree-like structures.
* API intoduced. It's now possible (recommended) to work with codifiers 
  using only functions, without referring codes tables.


Changes from 0.2 to 0.3
--------------------------------------------
* New version of STANDARD (0.3)
